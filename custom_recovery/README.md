# Custom Recovery

## First off, what is custom recovery?
Custom recovery is a replacement of your existing recovery menu in your Android phone, allowing for several features that are not normally supported by stock recovery images. Being a custom recovery, it's able to do everything your device's normal recovery menu can do and more.
