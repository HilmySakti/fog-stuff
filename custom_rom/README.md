## What is custom ROM?
To make it short, custom ROM is an Android operating system based on Google's AOSP or Qualcomm's CAF (on Snapdragon phones). A lot of people are using custom ROM due to stability and lots of customization that it has. Custom ROM is also a good way to keep your device up-to-date if your device is no longer receiving security/major updates from your OEM.
