## What is custom ROM?
To make it short, custom ROM is an Android operating system based on Google's AOSP or Qualcomm's CAF (on Snapdragon phones). A lot of people are using custom ROM due to stability and lots of customization that it has. Custom ROM is also a good way to keep your device up-to-date if your device is no longer receiving security/major updates from your OEM.

Keep in mind that I can't provide any screenshots of listed ROMs here because I haven't tried any of these ROMs at the moment, since I use the phone for daily driving and I'm trying to not switch between ROMs as frequent as possible because I have to backup my data all over again just to experience a new ROM. Sorry for the inconvenience!

<!-- >
If anyone can provide screenshots for each ROM listed here, you can either:
- Make a pull request with screenshots included
- Make a new issue with screenshots so I can put them here by myself
- Contact me directly on Discord (@loominatrx#4843)

Your help is appreciated! :D
